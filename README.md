# OmniGateway

One endpoint in front of the AI accounts you already pay for.

OmniGateway is a self-hosted gateway that speaks the Anthropic and OpenAI APIs
and answers them using your own Anthropic, OpenAI, and Kimi Coding
subscriptions. Point any compatible client at it, ask for a model you defined,
and the gateway picks an account that can serve it — falling back to another
when one is rate-limited, expired, or out of quota.

It runs on one machine, stores everything in a local SQLite file, and never
logs the contents of your prompts or replies.

```bash
bun install -g omnigateway
omni start
```

> Status: in use and complete for its scope. Version 1 targets a single
> machine and a single operator — see [Scope](#scope-and-limits).

## What it does

- **Speaks both dialects.** `POST /v1/messages` (Anthropic) and
  `POST /v1/chat/completions` (OpenAI), including streaming, translated to
  whichever provider actually serves the request.
- **Routes across your accounts.** Define a virtual model like `fast` or
  `smart` with several targets; the gateway ranks them by tier, health,
  remaining quota, cost, and latency.
- **Fails over.** A rate-limited or broken account is skipped, its circuit
  breaker opens, and the next candidate is tried — before the response starts
  streaming.
- **Keeps OAuth alive.** Tokens refresh in the background, before a request
  needs them.
- **Watches provider quota.** It asks each provider what you have left and
  routes by *pace*: 5% remaining is fine minutes before a reset and urgent with
  six days to run.
- **Issues its own keys.** Hand out gateway keys with per-key model allowlists
  and rate limits instead of sharing provider credentials.
- **Reports usage.** Requests, tokens, and cost by provider, model, key, and
  day — metadata only.
- **Ships an admin console and a CLI.** Both cover the same ground; use
  whichever suits the machine you are on.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.4 or later. Bun is the runtime, not just the
  installer, so a Node-only machine cannot run OmniGateway.
- A directory that persists, for the SQLite database.
- At least one Anthropic, OpenAI, or Kimi Coding account to connect.

## Install

```bash
bun install -g omnigateway     # or: npm i -g omnigateway
```

One package carries the `omni` CLI, the gateway server, and the admin console
the server hosts.

## Getting started

Pick a directory to hold the database and configuration. `~/.config/omnigateway`
is where `omni` looks by default:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omnigateway && cd ~/.config/omnigateway
printf 'OMNI_ENCRYPTION_KEY=%s\n' "$(openssl rand -base64 32)" > .env
```

That key encrypts your provider credentials at rest. **Keep it. Changing it
makes every stored credential unreadable**, and there is no recovery path
except reconnecting the accounts.

Then set up and start:

```bash
omni db migrate            # create the database
omni admin set-password    # prompts; the console signs in with this
omni start                 # serves the API and the console on 127.0.0.1:9000
```

Connect an account. The CLI prints a URL to open, and waits:

```bash
omni connect anthropic     # or: openai, kimi
```

Define a virtual model your clients will ask for, seeding its pricing and
capabilities from the built-in catalog:

```bash
omni models catalog                                  # what is available
omni models put fast --from-catalog anthropic:claude-sonnet-5
```

Mint a key for your client. **It is printed once and stored only as a hash:**

```bash
omni keys create --label laptop
```

Now use it:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:9000/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'authorization: Bearer <gateway-key>' \
  -d '{"model": "fast", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```

Everything above is also available in the browser at
`http://127.0.0.1:9000`, which walks the same steps.

## Using it from a client

| Method | Path | Compatible with |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages API |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions API |
| `GET` | `/v1/models` | Listing in both dialects, filtered by your key's allowlist |
| `GET` | `/health` | Unauthenticated liveness check |

Authenticate with either header — sending both is an error:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <gateway-key>
x-api-key: <gateway-key>
```

Ask for one of your virtual models by name. A bare provider model
(`claude-sonnet-5`, `gpt-5`) also works if an account can serve it.

`GET /v1/models` answers both client families from one listing: each entry
carries the OpenAI keys (`object`, `created`, `owned_by`) and the Anthropic ones
(`type`, `display_name`, `created_at`, `max_input_tokens`, `max_tokens`) at
once. `max_input_tokens` is the one worth knowing about — a client that is told
no context window assumes its own default, which is 200K whatever the model
really holds, so a 1M-context target would be used as if it were a fifth of its
size. The figure is the smallest window any of that model's targets can hold,
because failover can land on any of them.

A client reads these figures once, when it starts, and caches them — so
raising a limit here can take a client restart to show up.

The figures come from the published limits for the model each target names, and
from how the credential that would serve it signs in: an OpenAI account
connected by OAuth is served through the Codex backend, which takes a 272,000
token prompt where the API takes 922,000, so a gateway with both kinds of
OpenAI credential advertises the smaller. Leave the fields in the console (or
the CLI) empty to keep that worked out for you, and fill them in per target only
when your own account's limits differ. A model outside the built-in catalog with
nothing stated is left undescribed, and its clients keep their own defaults.

Most tools that accept a custom base URL work unchanged: set it to
`http://127.0.0.1:9000` and use a gateway key where the provider key goes.

## The CLI

`omni --help` lists everything; `omni <command> --help` explains one. Every
command takes `--json` for scripting, and `--root <path>` to manage an
installation other than the default.

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `omni status` | the gateway, its accounts, and their quota, on one screen |
| `omni start` / `stop` / `restart` | run the gateway; `--foreground` attaches it to your terminal |
| `omni doctor` | which installation it resolved, and whether it can act on it |
| `omni logs` | recent requests as the gateway recorded them |
| `omni console` | the gateway process's own output: boot, refreshes, quota, errors |
| `omni usage` | spend and tokens, by provider, model, key, or day |
| `omni connect <provider>` | authorize an account from the terminal |
| `omni credentials …` | list, show, enable, disable, retier, refresh, remove |
| `omni models …` | list, show, put, remove, `dry-run`, `catalog` |
| `omni keys …` | list, create, revoke |
| `omni settings get` / `set` | routing weights, retention, deadlines |
| `omni admin set-password` | change the console password |
| `omni db migrate` | create or upgrade the database |

Two worth knowing:

`omni models dry-run fast` shows exactly where a request would go and why —
each candidate's score, and every account that was excluded with the reason.

`omni status` is the "is anything wrong" command: process state, per-account
health, and how much provider quota each account has left.

## Running it as a service

On a machine with systemd:

```bash
omni service install --enable    # writes a user unit for this installation
omni start                       # from here on, start/stop delegate to systemctl
omni console                     # reads the journal (or the log file, without systemd)
```

Use `--system` for a system-wide unit (needs root). Without systemd, `omni
start` supervises the process itself with a pidfile under
`~/.local/state/omnigateway`. Either way, `omni start` returns only once
`/health` actually answers.

## Configuration

Configuration is environment variables, read from the installation's `.env`:

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OMNI_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Yes | — | Encrypts provider credentials at rest; 16 characters minimum |
| `OMNI_HOST` | No | `127.0.0.1` | Listener host |
| `OMNI_PORT` | No | `9000` | Listener port |
| `OMNI_DB_PATH` | No | `./omnigateway.db` | SQLite database path |
| `OMNI_BASE_URL` | No | derived from host and port | Public origin for OAuth callbacks; set this behind a reverse proxy |
| `OMNI_STATIC_DIR` | No | the console shipped with the server | Serve a different console build |
| `OMNI_LOG_LEVEL` | No | `info` | Stdout threshold: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, or `error` |
| `OMNI_LOG_FILE` | No | the systemd journal, when there is one | Where stdout was already redirected, so the Console screen can read it back. Names a file; does not create one |

Gateway events are written to stdout as one greppable line each: process lifecycle, OAuth
refreshes, quota probes, failover, and errors. Completed requests are *not* among them — they
are recorded in the database and read back through `omni logs` and the console's Logs screen.
Use `debug` to add routing decisions, per-attempt tracing, and upstream HTTP timing:

```text
2026-08-09T04:12:04.881Z WARN  attempt failed; retrying  requestId=req_9f2 provider=anthropic attempt=1 code=UPSTREAM retryable=true
```

Fields are a closed allowlist: logs never include request or response bodies, headers, OAuth
tokens, API keys, admin passwords, or encryption keys. `OMNI_LOG_LEVEL` is read once at boot;
an invalid value falls back to `info` and is reported in the boot log.

The Console screen and `omni console` show these lines. A process cannot read back its own
stdout, so both read whatever captured it: `OMNI_LOG_FILE` if set, otherwise the systemd
journal. Run the gateway in the foreground and its output goes to your terminal, where nothing
captured it — both surfaces say so rather than showing an empty log.

`OMNI_LOG_FILE` *names* where output was captured; it does not redirect it. Setting it alone
leaves the log empty, because the gateway still writes to stdout. Redirect the output and name
the same path:

```bash
bun apps/gateway/src/index.ts >> /var/log/omni.log 2>&1
```

`omni start` does both for the gateway it supervises, and under systemd the journal needs no
setup.

Routing behaviour — weights, retry limits, request deadline, log retention,
how often provider quota is polled — lives in the database, not the
environment. Edit it with `omni settings set` or in the console.

`.env.example` in the repository documents the optional provider
client-identity overrides.

## Docker

```bash
docker build -t omnigateway .
docker run --rm \
  -p 9000:9000 \
  -e OMNI_ENCRYPTION_KEY="$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
  -v omnigateway-data:/data \
  omnigateway
```

The container listens on `0.0.0.0:9000` and keeps its database at
`/data/omnigateway.db`. Note that **the image builds the gateway only**: it
serves the APIs and returns 404 for the console. Use the CLI or the control API
against it, or install the npm package if you want the console.

## Scope and limits

Worth knowing before you deploy it:

- **One machine, one operator.** No multi-tenancy, no clustering, no shared
  state. Rate limits are counted per process and reset when it restarts.
- **Two grains of usage history.** Detailed request logs are pruned after 30
  days by default; a daily rollup is kept for 400 days. A day is your host's
  local midnight, fixed when the row is written.
- **Quota readings come from the providers**, and their usage endpoints are
  undocumented. An account with nothing reported is treated as unknown, never
  as unlimited.
- **The gateway does not know which model accepts which request shape.** An
  unsupported combination surfaces as the provider's own 400 rather than being
  caught earlier.
- Not in scope for version 1: semantic caching, billing, prompt storage,
  horizontal scaling.

## Security

- Treat `OMNI_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, gateway keys, and the SQLite file as secrets.
  Anyone with the file *and* the key has your provider credentials.
- Prompts and responses are never logged. Request logs hold metadata and token
  counts only.
- Gateway keys are stored as hashes. A lost key is reissued, not recovered.
- Secrets are never accepted on the command line — `omni` prompts for them or
  reads stdin — so they stay out of your shell history and the process table.
- Behind a reverse proxy, set `OMNI_BASE_URL` to the public HTTPS origin so
  OAuth callbacks match what the providers have registered.
- The gateway talks to your providers and to nobody else. No telemetry, no CDN
  fonts, no third-party origins.
